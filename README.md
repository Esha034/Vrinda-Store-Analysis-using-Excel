## 3. Business Problem

Vrinda Store needed a concise and interactive way to monitor yearly performance and make data-driven decisions. However, the raw dataset lacked structure and didn’t provide direct insights into:

1. Monthly sales fluctuations

2. Top-performing states

3. Gender-wise and age-wise order trends

4. Channel contribution (Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, etc.)

5. Order status patterns (Delivered, Cancelled, Returned)

The goal was to build a dashboard that summarizes all these metrics in a visually clear format to support business decisions.
